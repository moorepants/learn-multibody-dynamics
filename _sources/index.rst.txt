This online book aims to teach multibody dynamics using interactive code woven
into the text. It follows the organization and methods presented in [Kane1985]_
and can be thought of a retelling of many topics in the book. Each page can be
downloaded as a Python_ script or  Jupyter_ Notebook. The book is also
`available in PDF format <learnmultibodydynamics.pdf>`_. This book is used
primarily as a companion resource for TU Delft's `Multibody Dynamics`_ course
taught by `Jason K. Moore`_ but it is designed to standalone from the course.

.. todo:: If you make a section header "Table of Contents" then all the primary
   pages become sections instead of chapters in the latex document. But with
   the caption set to "Table of Contents" they don't but in HTML there is no
   section header in the table of contents for the table of contents.
