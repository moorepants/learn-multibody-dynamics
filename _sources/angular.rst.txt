Introduction
============

To apply `Euler's Laws of Motion`_ to a multibody system we will need to
determine how the `angular momentum`_ of each rigid body changes with time.
This requires that we specify the angular kinematics of each body in the
system: typically both angular velocity and angular acceleration. Assuming that
a reference frame is fixed to a rigid body, we will start by finding the
angular kinematics of a single reference frame and then use the properties of
:ref:`Successive Orientations` to find the angular kinematics of a set of
related reference frames.

.. _Euler's Laws of Motion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_laws_of_motion
.. _angular momentum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum

In the video below, a small T-handle is shown spinning in low Earth orbit
gravity onboard the International Space Station. This single rigid body has an
orientation, angular velocity, and angular acceleration at any given instance
of time.

The T-handle exhibits unintuitive motion, reversing back and forth
periodically. This phenomena is commonly referred to as the "`Dzhanibekov
effect`_" and Euler's Laws of Motion predict the behavior, which we will
investigate in later chapters. For now, we will learn how to specify the
angular kinematics of a reference frame in motion, such as one fixed to this
T-handle.

Angular Velocity
================

In Ch. :ref:`Orientation of Reference Frames` we learned that reference frames
can be oriented relative to each other. If the relative orientation of two
reference frames change with respect to time, then we can calculate the angular
velocity of reference frame :math:`B` when observed from reference frame
:math:`A`. This vector is written with the notation :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B`.
If :math:`\hat{b}_x,\hat{b}_y,\hat{b}_z` are right handed mutually
perpendicular unit vectors fixed in :math:`B` then the angular velocity of
:math:`B` when observed from :math:`A` is defined as ([Kane1985]_, pg.  16):

.. math::
   :label: angular-velocity-definition

   {}^A\bar{\omega}^B :=
   \left(\frac{{}^A d\hat{b}_y}{dt} \cdot \hat{b}_z\right) \hat{b}_x +
   \left(\frac{{}^A d\hat{b}_z}{dt} \cdot \hat{b}_x\right) \hat{b}_y +
   \left(\frac{{}^A d\hat{b}_x}{dt} \cdot \hat{b}_y\right) \hat{b}_z
   \textrm{.}

.. warning::

   Don't confuse the left and right superscripts on direction cosine matrices
   and angular velocities. :math:`{}^B\mathbf{C}^A` describes the orientation
   of :math:`B` rotated with respect to :math:`A` and the mapping of vectors in
   :math:`A` to vectors expressed in :math:`B`. Whereas
   :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B` describes the angular velocity of :math:`B`
   **when observed** from :math:`A`.

If :math:`B` is oriented with respect to :math:`A` and mutually perpendicular
unit vectors :math:`\hat{a}_x,\hat{a}_y,\hat{a}_z` are fixed in :math:`A` then
there are these general relationships among the unit vectors of each frame (see
:ref:`Direction Cosine Matrices`):

.. math::
   :label: unit-vector-general-relation

   \hat{b}_x & = c_{xx} \hat{a}_x + c_{xy} \hat{a}_y + c_{xz} \hat{a}_z \\
   \hat{b}_y & = c_{yx} \hat{a}_x + c_{yy} \hat{a}_y + c_{yz} \hat{a}_z \\
   \hat{b}_z & = c_{zx} \hat{a}_x + c_{zy} \hat{a}_y + c_{zz} \hat{a}_z

We can create these equations in SymPy to demonstrate how to work with the
definition of angular velocity. Start by first creating the direction cosine
matrix with time varying elements:

.. jupyter-execute::

   cxx, cyy, czz = me.dynamicsymbols('c_{xx}, c_{yy}, c_{zz}')
   cxy, cxz, cyx = me.dynamicsymbols('c_{xy}, c_{xz}, c_{yx}')
   cyz, czx, czy = me.dynamicsymbols('c_{yz}, c_{zx}, c_{zy}')

   B_C_A = sm.Matrix([[cxx, cxy, cxz],
                      [cyx, cyy, cyz],
                      [czx, czy, czz]])

and establish the orientation using
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.orient_explicit`:

.. warning::

   Remember this method takes the transpose of the direction cosine matrix.

.. jupyter-execute::

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_explicit(A, B_C_A.transpose())
   B.dcm(A)

This now let's write the :math:`B` unit vectors in terms of the :math:`A` unit
vectors:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.x.express(A)

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.y.express(A)

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.z.express(A)

Recalling the definition of angular velocity above, each of the measure numbers
of the angular velocity is calculated by dotting the derivative of a :math:`B`
unit vector in :math:`A` with a unit vector in :math:`B`. :math:`\frac{{}^A
\hat{b}_y}{dt}` is for example:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.y.express(A).dt(A)

Each of the measure numbers of :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B` are then:

.. jupyter-execute::

   mnx = me.dot(B.y.express(A).dt(A), B.z)
   mnx

.. jupyter-execute::

   mny = me.dot(B.z.express(A).dt(A), B.x)
   mny

.. jupyter-execute::

   mnz = me.dot(B.x.express(A).dt(A), B.y)
   mnz

The angular velocity vector for an arbitrary direction cosine matrix is then:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_B = mnx*B.x + mny*B.y + mnz*B.z
   A_w_B

If you know the direction cosine matrix and the derivative of its entries with
respect to time, the angular velocity can be directly calculated with the above
equation.

.. admonition:: Exercise

   At one instance of time, the direction cosine matrix is:

   .. math::

      {}^B\mathbf{C}^A =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} \\
        -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\
        \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} & - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}
      \end{bmatrix}

   and the time derivatives of the entries of the direction cosine matrix are:

   .. math::

      \frac{d{}^B\mathbf{C}^A}{dt} =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{4} & - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} & - \frac{3 \sqrt{6}}{4} + \sqrt{2}\\
        -1 & - \frac{1}{2} & - \sqrt{3}\\
        - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{4} & - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{3 \sqrt{6}}{4}
      \end{bmatrix}

   apply the definition of angular velocity to find :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B`.

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: dropdown

   Define the two matrices:

   .. jupyter-execute::

      B_C_A = sm.Matrix([
          [ sm.sqrt(2)/4,  sm.sqrt(2)/2, sm.sqrt(6)/4],
          [-sm.sqrt(3)/2,          0,       sm.S(1)/2],
          [ sm.sqrt(2)/4, -sm.sqrt(2)/2, sm.sqrt(6)/4]
      ])
      B_C_A

   .. jupyter-execute::

      B_C_A_dt = sm.Matrix([
          [-sm.sqrt(6)/2 - 3*sm.sqrt(2)/4, -sm.sqrt(6)/4 + 3*sm.sqrt(2)/2, -3*sm.sqrt(6)/4 + sm.sqrt(2)],
          [                      -1,                     -sm.S(1)/2,               -sm.sqrt(3)],
          [-sm.sqrt(6)/2 + 3*sm.sqrt(2)/4, -sm.sqrt(6)/4 + 3*sm.sqrt(2)/2,            3*sm.sqrt(6)/4]
      ])
      B_C_A_dt

   Recognizing the pattern in the definition of angular velocity, rows of each
   matrix can be matrix multiplied to arrive at the correct measure number:

   .. jupyter-execute::

      mnx = (B_C_A[2, :]*B_C_A_dt[1, :].transpose())[0, 0]
      mny = (B_C_A[0, :]*B_C_A_dt[2, :].transpose())[0, 0]
      mnz = (B_C_A[1, :]*B_C_A_dt[0, :].transpose())[0, 0]

      A_w_B = mnx*B.x + mny*B.y + mnz*B.z

   :external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.vector.Vector.simplify` applies
   :external:py:func:`~sympy.simplify.simplify.simplify` to each measure number
   of a vector:

   .. jupyter-execute::

      A_w_B.simplify()

Angular Velocity of Simple Orientations
=======================================

For a simple orientation of :math:`B` with respect to :math:`A` about the
:math:`z` axis through :math:`\theta` the direction cosine matrix is:

.. jupyter-execute::

   theta = me.dynamicsymbols('theta')

   B_C_A = sm.Matrix([[sm.cos(theta), sm.sin(theta), 0],
                      [-sm.sin(theta), sm.cos(theta), 0],
                      [0, 0, 1]])

   B_C_A

Applying the definition of angular velocity as before, the angular velocity of
:math:`B` in :math:`A` is:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_explicit(A, B_C_A.transpose())

   mnx = me.dot(B.y.express(A).dt(A), B.z)
   mny = me.dot(B.z.express(A).dt(A), B.x)
   mnz = me.dot(B.x.express(A).dt(A), B.y)

   A_w_B = mnx*B.x + mny*B.y + mnz*B.z
   A_w_B

This can be simplified with a trigonometric identity. We can do this with
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.vector.Vector.simplify` which applies
``simplify()`` to each measure number of a vector:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_B.simplify()

The angular velocity of a simple orientation is simply the time rate of change
of :math:`\theta` about :math:`\hat{b}_z=\hat{a}_z`, the axis of
the simple orientation. SymPy Mechanics offers the
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in`
method for automatically calculating the angular velocity if a direction cosine
matrix exists between the two reference frames:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_axis(A, theta, A.z)
   B.ang_vel_in(A)

.. todo:: SymPy behavior: Should this return the angular velocity expressed in
   the body fixed frame?

A simple orientation and associated simple angular velocity can be formulated
for any arbitrary orientation axis vector, not just one of the three mutually
perpendicular unit vectors as shown above. There is a simple angular velocity
between two reference frames :math:`A` and :math:`B` if there exists a single
unit vector :math:`\hat{k}` which is fixed in both :math:`A` and :math:`B` for
some finite time. If this is the case, then :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B = \omega
\hat{k}` where :math:`\omega` is the time rate of change of the angle
:math:`\theta` between a line fixed in :math:`A` and another line fixed in
:math:`B` both of which are perpendicular to the orientation axis
:math:`\hat{k}`.  We call :math:`\omega=\dot{\theta}` the :term:`angular speed`
of :math:`B` in :math:`A`.
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.orient_axis` can
take any arbitrary vector fixed in :math:`A` and :math:`B` to establish the
orientation:

.. jupyter-execute::

   theta = me.dynamicsymbols('theta')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_axis(A, theta, A.x + A.y)
   B.ang_vel_in(A)

The angular speed is then:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.ang_vel_in(A).magnitude()

.. note:: This result could more properly be :math:`|\dot{\theta}|`. This is an
   outstanding issue in SymPy, see https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/23173
   for more info. This generally will not cause issues, but for certain
   equation of motion derivations it could not be ideal, so beware.

Body Fixed Orientations
=======================

If you establish a Euler :math:`z\textrm{-}x\textrm{-}z` orientation with
angles :math:`\psi,\theta,\varphi` respectively, then the angular velocity
vector is:

.. jupyter-execute::

   psi, theta, phi = me.dynamicsymbols('psi, theta, varphi')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_body_fixed(A, (psi, theta, phi), 'ZXZ')

   mnx = me.dot(B.y.express(A).dt(A), B.z)
   mny = me.dot(B.z.express(A).dt(A), B.x)
   mnz = me.dot(B.x.express(A).dt(A), B.y)

   A_w_B = mnx*B.x + mny*B.y + mnz*B.z
   A_w_B.simplify()

The method
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in` does
this same calculation and gives the same result:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.ang_vel_in(A)

.. admonition:: Exercise

   Calculate the angular velocity of the T-handle :math:`T` with respect to the
   space station :math:`N` if :math:`\hat{t}_z` is parallel to the spin axis,
   :math:`\hat{t}_y` is parallel with the handle axis, and :math:`\hat{t}_x` is
   normal to the plane made by the "T" and follows from the right hand rule.
   Select Euler angles that avoid `gimbal lock`_. *Hint: Read "Loss of degree
   of freedom with Euler angles" in the gimbal lock article.*

   .. _gimbal lock: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: dropdown

   .. jupyter-execute::

      psi, theta, phi = me.dynamicsymbols('psi, theta, varphi')

      N = me.ReferenceFrame('N')
      T = me.ReferenceFrame('T')
      T.orient_body_fixed(N, (psi, theta, phi), 'xyz')

   To check whether the :math:`x\textrm{-}y\textrm{-}z` body fixed rotation
   angles we chose are suitable for the observed moition in the video we first
   estimate the likely bounds of motion in terms of multiples of :math:`\pi/2`.
   For our Euler angles this seems reasonable:

   .. math::

      0       \leq \psi    \leq \pi \\
      -\pi/2  \leq \theta  \leq \pi/2 \\
      -\infty \leq \varphi \leq \infty

   Now we can check the direction cosine matrix at the limits of :math:`\psi`
   and :math:`\theta` to see if they reduce the direction cosine matrix to a
   form that indicates gimbal lock.

   .. jupyter-execute::

      sm.trigsimp(T.dcm(N).xreplace({psi: 0}))

   .. jupyter-execute::

      sm.trigsimp(T.dcm(N).xreplace({psi: sm.pi}))

   These first matrices show that we can still orient the handle if
   :math:`\psi` is at its limits.

   .. jupyter-execute::

      sm.trigsimp(T.dcm(N).xreplace({theta: -sm.pi/2}))

   .. jupyter-execute::

      sm.trigsimp(T.dcm(N).xreplace({theta: sm.pi/2}))

   These second set of matrices show that gimbal lock can occur if
   :math:`\theta` reaches its limits. But for the observed motion this limit
   shouldn't ever be reached. So we can use this Euler angle set to model the
   T-handle for the observed motion without worry of gimbal lock.

Time Derivatives of Vectors
===========================

Using the definition of angular velocity one can show ([Kane1985]_, pg. 17)
that the time derivative of a unit vector **fixed in** :math:`B` is related to
:math:`B`'s angular velocity by the following theorem:

.. math::
   :label: time-derivative-fixed-unit-vector

   \frac{{}^Ad\hat{b}_x}{dt} = {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times \hat{b}_x

This indicates that the time derivative is always normal to the unit vector
because the magnitude of the unit vector is constant and the derivative scales
with the magnitude of the angular velocity:

.. math::
   :label: time-derivative-unit-vector-scalar-mag

   \frac{{}^Ad\hat{b}_x}{dt} = \left| {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \right| \left( {}^A\hat{\omega}^B \times \hat{b}_x \right)

Now if vector :math:`\bar{v} = v\hat{b}_x` and :math:`v` is constant with
respect to time we can infer:

.. math::
   :label: time-derivative-fixed-vector

   \frac{{}^A d\bar{v}}{dt} =
   v({}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times \hat{b}_x) =
   {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times v\hat{b}_x =
   {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times \bar{v}

Eq. :math:numref:`time-derivative-fixed-unit-vector` extends to any vector
**fixed in** :math:`B` and observed from :math:`A`, making the time derivative
equal to the cross product of the angular velocity of :math:`B` in :math:`A`
with the vector.

Now, if :math:`\bar{u}` is a vector that is **not fixed in** :math:`B` we
return to the product rule in Section :ref:`Product Rule` and first express
:math:`\bar{u}` in :math:`B`:

.. math::
   :label: time-varying-vector

   \bar{u} = u_1\hat{b}_x + u_2\hat{b}_y + u_3\hat{b}_z

Taking the derivative in another reference frame :math:`A` by applying the
product rule and applying the above theorems let us arrive at this new theorem:

.. math::
   :label: deriv-arb-vector

   \frac{{}^Ad\bar{u}}{dt} &=
   \dot{u}_1\hat{b}_x + \dot{u}_2\hat{b}_y + \dot{u}_3\hat{b}_z +
   u_1\frac{{}^Ad\hat{b}_x}{dt} + u_2\frac{{}^Ad\hat{b}_y}{dt} + u_3\frac{{}^Ad\hat{b}_z}{dt} \\
   \frac{{}^Ad\bar{u}}{dt} &=
   \frac{{}^Bd\bar{u}}{dt} +
   u_1{}^A\bar{\omega}^B\times\hat{b}_x + u_2{}^A\bar{\omega}^B\times\hat{b}_y + u_3{}^A\bar{\omega}^B\times\hat{b}_z \\
   \frac{{}^Ad\bar{u}}{dt} &=
   \frac{{}^Bd\bar{u}}{dt} +
   {}^A\bar{\omega}^B\times\bar{u}

Eq. :math:numref:`deriv-arb-vector` is a powerful equation because it lets us
differentiate any vector if we know how it changes in a rotating reference
frame relative to the reference frame we are observing the change from.

We can show that Eq. :math:numref:`deriv-arb-vector` holds with an example.
Take a :math:`z\textrm{-}x` orientation and an arbitrary vector that is not
fixed in :math:`B`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_body_fixed(A, (psi, theta, 0), 'ZXZ')

   u1, u2, u3 = me.dynamicsymbols('u1, u2, u3')

   u = u1*B.x + u2*B.y + u3*B.z
   u

As we learned in the last chapter we can express the vector in :math:`A` and
then take the time derivative of the measure numbers to arrive at
:math:`\frac{{}^Ad\bar{u}}{dt}`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   u.express(A)

.. jupyter-execute::

   u.express(A).dt(A)

But applying the theorem above we can find the derivative with a cross product.
The nice aspect of this formulation is there is no need to express the vector
in :math:`A`. First :math:`\frac{{}^Bd\bar{u}}{dt}`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   u.dt(B)

and then :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_B = B.ang_vel_in(A)
   A_w_B

:math:`\frac{{}^Ad\bar{u}}{dt}` is then:

.. jupyter-execute::

   u.dt(B) + me.cross(A_w_B, u)

which is a relatively simple form of the derivative when expressed in the
rotating reference frame.

We can show that the first result is equivalent by expressing in :math:`B` and
simplifying:

.. jupyter-execute::

   u.express(A).dt(A).express(B).simplify()

.. admonition:: Exercise

   Show that ``.dt()`` uses the theorem Eq. :math:numref:`deriv-arb-vector`
   internally.

   .. jupyter-execute::

   .. jupyter-execute::

      u.dt(B) + me.cross(A_w_B, u)

Addition of Angular Velocity
============================

Similar to the relationship in direction cosine matrices of successive
orientations (Sec. :ref:`Successive Orientations`), there is a relationship
among the angular velocities of successively oriented reference frames
([Kane1985]_, pg. 24) but it relies on the addition of vectors instead of
multiplication of matrices. The theorem is:

.. math::
   :label: addition-angular-velocity

   {}^A\bar{\omega}^Z =
   {}^A\bar{\omega}^B +
   {}^B\bar{\omega}^C +
   \ldots +
   {}^Y\bar{\omega}^Z

We can demonstrate this by creating three simple orientations for a Euler
:math:`y\textrm{-}x\textrm{-}y` orientation:

.. jupyter-execute::

   psi, theta, phi = me.dynamicsymbols('psi, theta, varphi')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   C = me.ReferenceFrame('C')
   D = me.ReferenceFrame('D')

   B.orient_axis(A, psi, A.y)
   C.orient_axis(B, theta, B.x)
   D.orient_axis(C, phi, C.y)

The simple angular velocity of each successive orientation is shown:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_B = B.ang_vel_in(A)
   A_w_B

.. jupyter-execute::

   B_w_C = C.ang_vel_in(B)
   B_w_C

.. jupyter-execute::

   C_w_D = D.ang_vel_in(C)
   C_w_D

Summing the successive angular velocities gives the compact result:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_D = A_w_B + B_w_C + C_w_D
   A_w_D

Similarly, we can skip the auxiliary frames and form the relationship between
:math:`A` and :math:`D` directly and calculate :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^D`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A2 = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   D2 = me.ReferenceFrame('D')
   D2.orient_body_fixed(A2, (psi, theta, phi), 'YXY')
   D2.ang_vel_in(A2).simplify()

If we express our prior result in :math:`D` we see the results are the same:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_w_D.express(D)

.. todo:: I could show with three generic direction cosine matrices that the
   angular velocities add up, but that would be a bit messy presentation.

Angular Acceleration
====================

The angular acceleration of :math:`B` when observed from :math:`A` is defined
as:

.. math::
   :label: angular-acceleration-definition

   {}^A\bar{\alpha}^B := \frac{{}^Ad}{dt} {}^A\bar{\omega}^B

:math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B` is simply a vector so we can time differentiate it
with respect to frame :math:`A`. Using Eq. :math:numref:`deriv-arb-vector` we
can write:

.. math::
   :label: angular-acceleration-cross

   \frac{{}^Ad}{dt} {}^A\bar{\omega}^B & =
   \frac{{}^Bd}{dt} {}^A\bar{\omega}^B + {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times {}^A\bar{\omega}^B \\

and since :math:`{}^A\bar{\omega}^B \times {}^A\bar{\omega}^B=0`:

.. math::
   :label: ang-acc-frame

   \frac{{}^Ad}{dt} {}^A\bar{\omega}^B = \frac{{}^Bd}{dt} {}^A\bar{\omega}^B

which is rather convenient.

With SymPy Mechanics :math:`{}^A\bar{\alpha}^B` is found automatically with
:external:py:meth:`~sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.ang_acc_in` if
the orientations are established. For a simple orientation:

.. jupyter-execute::

   theta = me.dynamicsymbols('theta')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   B.orient_axis(A, theta, A.z)
   B.ang_acc_in(A)

Similarly we can calculate the derivative manually:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.ang_vel_in(A).dt(A)

and see that that Eq. :math:numref:`ang-acc-frame` holds:

.. jupyter-execute::

   B.ang_vel_in(A).dt(B)

For a body fixed orientation we get:

.. jupyter-execute::

   psi, theta, phi = me.dynamicsymbols('psi, theta, varphi')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   D = me.ReferenceFrame('D')
   D.orient_body_fixed(A, (psi, theta, phi), 'YXY')

   D.ang_acc_in(A).simplify()

and with manual derivatives of the measure numbers:

.. jupyter-execute::

   D.ang_vel_in(A).dt(A).simplify()

.. jupyter-execute::

   D.ang_vel_in(A).dt(D).simplify()

Note the equivalence regardless of the frame the change in velocity is observed
from.

Addition of Angular Acceleration
================================

The calculation of angular acceleration is relatively simple due to the
equivalence when observed from different reference frames, but the addition of
angular velocities explained in Sec. :ref:`Addition of Angular Velocity` does
not extend to angular accelerations. Adding successive angular accelerations
does not result in a valid total angular acceleration.

.. math::
   :label: addition-angular-acceleration

   {}^A\bar{\alpha}^Z \neq
   {}^A\bar{\alpha}^B +
   {}^B\bar{\alpha}^C +
   \ldots +
   {}^Y\bar{\alpha}^Z

We can show by example that an equality in Eq.
:math:numref:`addition-angular-acceleration` will  not hold. Coming back to the
successive orientations that form a :math:`y\textrm{-}x\textrm{-}y` Euler
rotation, we can test the relationship.

.. jupyter-execute::

   psi, theta, phi = me.dynamicsymbols('psi, theta, varphi')

   A = me.ReferenceFrame('A')
   B = me.ReferenceFrame('B')
   C = me.ReferenceFrame('C')
   D = me.ReferenceFrame('D')

   B.orient_axis(A, psi, A.y)
   C.orient_axis(B, theta, B.x)
   D.orient_axis(C, phi, C.y)

The simple angular acceleration of each successive orientation is shown:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_alp_B = B.ang_acc_in(A)
   A_alp_B

.. jupyter-execute::

   B_alp_C = C.ang_acc_in(B)
   B_alp_C

.. jupyter-execute::

   C_alp_D = D.ang_acc_in(C)
   C_alp_D

Summing the successive angular accelerations and expressing the resulting
vector in the body fixed reference frame :math:`D` gives this result:

.. jupyter-execute::

   A_alp_D = A_alp_B + B_alp_C + C_alp_D
   A_alp_D.express(D).simplify()

which is not equal to the correct, more complex, result:

.. jupyter-execute::

   D.ang_vel_in(A).dt(A).express(D).simplify()

Angular accelerations derived from successive orientations require an explicit
differentiation of the associated angular velocity vector. There unfortunately
is no theorem that simplifies this calculation as we see with orientation and
angular velocity.

.. todo:: Exericse that asks for angular acceleration of some linked system.
