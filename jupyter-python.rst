Introduction
============

The following is a brief introduction to Python and how to use Python from a
Jupyter Notebook. There is much more to learn than what is covered here. This
is just enough to get you started for the purposes of this book. You will need
to seek out the many excellent learning materials online to learn more; some
are provided at the end of this chapter.

The Jupyter Notebook
====================

The `Jupyter Notebook`_ is an application that lets you execute code to as well
as display text, mathematics, digital media, and HTML-CSS-Javascript-based
outputs. The displayed elements can be embedded directly or generated by the
executed code. This makes the Jupyter Notebook well suited for communicating
content that is linked and driven by code. It allows you to edit the code
interactively. Each page of this book is a Jupyter Notebook and can be
downloaded and executed on your computer. Jupyter can execute code from many
programming languages. Different :term:`kernels<kernel>` are used for each
language and a notebook can, in general, only have a single kernel. This book
will use the Python 3 kernel.

.. _Jupyter Notebook: https://www.jupyter.org

Using the Notebook
------------------

To start the Jupyter notebook application open a terminal (Linux/Mac) or
command prompt (Windows), navigate to a desired working directory then type the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter notebook

A new window will open in your web browser where you can open an existing
notebook or start a new one. Notebooks are organized with cells. You may have a
code cell for inputting commands followed by its result cell which contains the
output of the code. You may also have a text cell that contains static content
written in Markdown_. Markdown allows you to incorporate simple formatting and
even things like mathematical equations using LaTeX_ notation, e.g. ``$a^2$``
displays as :math:`a^2`. The cell type can be changed using a Jupyter drop-down
menu.

.. _Markdown: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
.. _LaTeX: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX

There is the menu bar above for navigating a notebook but you will find the
following keyboard shortcuts helpful:

- ``Enter`` : Create a new line with in cell
- ``Shift + Enter`` : Execute cell and advance to next cell
- ``Ctrl + Enter`` : Execute cell in place (do not advance to the next cell)
- Press ``esc`` (command mode) then ``h`` to display keyboard shortcuts

At times you might run code that gets stuck in an infinite loop or you might
simply want to clear all your workspace variables and start over. To solve each
of these problems you can click on the menu:

``Kernel -> Interrupt``

then

``Kernel -> Restart``

Magic Commands
--------------

These are special commands that only work in a Juypter notebook or an IPython
session, as opposed to the normal Python interpreter. Magic commands are
preceded by a ``%`` or ``%%``. You can list available magic commands but using
the magic command ``lsmagic``.

.. jupyter-execute::

   %lsmagic

For example ``%whos`` will show the variables available in your namespace:

.. jupyter-execute::

   a = 5

   %whos

Need Help?
----------

In case you're lost help isn't far. The following commands should provide
assistance.

``?`` displays an overview of the features available when typing in code cells
in Jupyter notebooks (the cells are parsed by the IPython Python interpreter
when using the Python kernel):

.. jupyter-execute::

   ?

A quick reference for the special commands in Jupyter code cells can be viewed
with:

.. jupyter-execute::

   %quickref

For details about any Python object in the namespace, append a ``?`` to the
variable or function (without ``()``). For example, help for the ``round()``
function can be found like so:

.. jupyter-execute::

   round?

Python
======

Python_ has become one of the world's most popular programming languages. It is
open source, free to use, and well suited for scientific and engineering
programming needs. The following gives a brief introduction to the basics of
Python.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org

Basic Data Types
----------------

Python has core builtin data types. The ``type()`` function shows you the type
of any Python object. For example, here are the types of some integers,
floating point numbers, and strings:

.. jupyter-execute::

    a = 5
    b = 5.0
    c = float(5)
    d = 'dee'
    e = 'e'
    f = 2+3j
    g = True

    type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d), type(e), type(f), type(g)

Data Structures
---------------

Python offers several builtin data structures for grouping and organizing
objects. Lists_, tuples_, and dictionaries_ are the most commonly used.

.. _Lists: https://docs.Python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list
.. _tuples: https://docs.Python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple
.. _dictionaries: https://docs.Python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict

Lists
^^^^^

A list is a versatile container that holds objects in the order given. Lists
are typically used to group similar items but may contain heterogeneous data
types.

.. jupyter-execute::

   empty_list = []

   string_list = ['lions', 'tigers', 'bears', 'sharks', 'hamsters']

   int_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

   int_list2 = list(range(5,10))

   list_from_variables = [a, b, c, d, e]

   list_of_lists = [empty_list,
                    string_list,
                    list_from_variables,
                    int_list,
                    int_list2]

Each of these can be displayed:

.. jupyter-execute::

   empty_list

.. jupyter-execute::

   string_list

.. jupyter-execute::

   int_list

.. jupyter-execute::

   int_list2

.. jupyter-execute::

   list_from_variables

.. jupyter-execute::

   list_of_lists

Elements of a list are accessible by their index.

.. warning::

   Beware that Python uses `zero-based numbering`_, i.e. the first index value
   is 0.

   .. _zero-based numbering: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering

.. jupyter-execute::

   string_list[0]

Slices can be used to extract a contiguous subset:

.. jupyter-execute::

   string_list[1:4]

Or subset patterns. This extracts every 2nd element:

.. jupyter-execute::

   int_list[::2]

To access an item in a nested list use successive square brackets:

.. jupyter-execute::

   list_of_lists[1][4]

Lists are :term:`mutable`, meaning after a list is created we can change, add,
or remove elements. Here are several ways to modify a list:

.. jupyter-execute::

   int_list[2] = 222

   int_list.append(5)

   string_list.remove('lions')

   list_from_variables.extend(int_list)

Note that the existing lists have been modified in-place:

.. jupyter-execute::

   int_list

.. jupyter-execute::

   string_list

.. jupyter-execute::

   list_from_variables

Tuples
^^^^^^

Tuples share similarities with lists. The primary difference between a list and
tuple is that tuples are **not mutable**. A tuple is good for organizing
related data that may be of different types. Note that tuples are defined with
parentheses, ``()``, rather than square brackets.

.. jupyter-execute::

    joe_blow = (32, 'tall', 'likes hats')
    joe_blow

Indexing works the same as lists:

.. jupyter-execute::

    joe_blow[1]

Unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They cannot be changed once defined. Trying
some of the mutating methods of lists results in errors on tuples:

.. jupyter-execute::
   :raises:

   joe_blow.append('married')

.. jupyter-execute::
   :raises:

   joe_blow[2] = 'not really a fan of hats'

In Python, a function can return multiple values. These multiple outputs are
packed into a tuple. Tuple unpacking assigns individual elements of a tuple to
separate variables.

.. jupyter-execute::

    pets = ('elephant', 'cow', 'rock')

    pet1, pet2, pet3 = pets

    pet1

A peculiar thing about tuples in Python is defining a single element tuple.
Note the trailing comma. This is necessary for Python to know you want a
one-element tuple.

.. jupyter-execute::

    tuple_with_one_item = pet1,

    tuple_with_one_item

Dictionaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dictionary is an unordered set of *key: value* pairs. Much like a language
dictionary where you look up a *word* and get its *definition*, in a Python
dictionary you look up a *key* and get its *value*.

Any immutable object can be used as a key, any object can be a value. For
example, here are strings as both keys and values:

.. jupyter-execute::

   dictionary0 = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}
   dictionary0

or integers  can be used as keys:

.. jupyter-execute::

   dictionary1 = {1: 'value1', 2: 'value2', 3: 'value3'}
   dictionary1

The keys and values can be extracted separately using ``.keys()`` and
``.values()`` and converting to a list:

.. jupyter-execute::

   list(dictionary1.keys())

.. jupyter-execute::

   list(dictionary1.values())

Individual items can be extracted with square brackets and the key:

.. jupyter-execute::

   cylinder = {'mass': 50, 'base': 10, 'height': 100}
   cylinder['mass']

The ``zip()`` function is a convenient way to help generate a dictionary.  It
takes sequence objects and combines them into a list of tuples. We can
subsequently use the list of four-element tuples to create a dictionary.

.. jupyter-execute::

    keys = ['mass01', 'inertia01', 'mass02', 'inertia02']
    values = [10, 1, 50, 5]
    dict(zip(keys, values))

Functions
---------

Python does not use braces, ``{}``, or ``end`` statements to separate blocks of
code. Rather, code blocks are initialized with colon, ``:``, and defined by
their indentation. It is convention to use four spaces (not tabs) for each
level of indentation. Functions are defined and used like so:

.. jupyter-execute::

   def abs_value(A):
       if A < 0:
           A = -A
       return A

   abs_value(-100)

.. jupyter-execute::

   abs_value(123)

This function returns two results:

.. jupyter-execute::

   def long_div(dividend, divisor):
       quotient = dividend // divisor  # // : floor division
       remainder = dividend % divisor  # % : modulo
       return quotient, remainder

Now you can use the function:

.. jupyter-execute::

   a = 430
   b = 25

   quo, rem = long_div(a, b)

   quo, rem

``print()`` and ``.format()`` can be used to make custom text to display:

.. jupyter-execute::

   msg = '{} divided {} is {} remainder {}'.format(a, b, quo, rem)
   print(msg)

Modules
-------

Modules add additional functionality not present in the default
:term:`namespace` of Python. Some modules are included with Python (builtin
modules) and some are provided by other software packages and libraries you
download and install. For example, the builtin ``sys`` module provides access
to system-specific parameters and functions. You can check what Python version
you are currently using by first importing the ``sys`` module and then
accessing the ``.version`` variable:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import sys

   print(sys.version)

You can also import the ``version`` variable to have it included in
the current namespace:

.. jupyter-execute::

   from sys import version

   print(version)

You will be using SymPy, NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib further along in this
book. These packages will consistently be imported like so:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import sympy as sm
   import numpy as np
   import scipy as sp
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This will allow you to keep the namespaces separate so that there are no
variable name clashes. For example, SymPy, NumPy, and SciPy all have
trigonometric functions:

.. jupyter-execute::

   sm.cos(12.0)

.. jupyter-execute::

   np.cos(12.0)

.. jupyter-execute::

   sp.cos(12.0)

and there may be times when you want to use more than one version of ``cos()``
in a single namespace.
