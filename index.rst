Learn Multibody Dynamics
========================

This online book aims to teach multibody dynamics using interactive code woven
into the text. It follows the organization and methods presented in [Kane1985]_
and can be thought of a retelling of many topics in the book. Each page can be
downloaded as a Python_ script or  Jupyter_ Notebook. The book is also
`available in PDF format <learnmultibodydynamics.pdf>`_. This book is used
primarily as a companion resource for TU Delft's `Multibody Dynamics B`_ course
taught by `Jason K.  Moore`_ but it is designed to standalone from the course.
